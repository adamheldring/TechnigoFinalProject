# WATCH YOUR TONE
## EXPLORING THE WEB AUDIO API

### FINAL PROJECT @ TECHNIGO BOOTCAMP

I wanted to make something that the user could actually mess around and play with. My first thought was to make a retro style game but when I stumbled upon the Web Audio API I felt strongly that a musical instrument would be great fun to make and hopefully just as fun to use. It also went well together with my original idea of a retro design.
