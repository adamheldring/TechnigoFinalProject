## EXPLORING THE WEB AUDIO API

### WEB SYNTH WITH DRUM MACHINE (...OR REALLY A 16-BAR STEP SEQUENSER)

I wanted to explore the Web Audio API. And being a musician at heart I felt it important to preserve the feeling you get while trying out a "real life" instrument like a hardware synth... that it's okay to really mess around and play with it. That you're allowed to turn all the knobs and press all the buttons. Like it's meant to be played with and that there is no wrong way. 

The idea was quickly matched with an over the top retro design to make it look more fun and less hostile. I've also only included the white keys from the friendly C-scale so you can't really go wrong. So no matter if you're a seasoned musician, a parent teaching your kid about music or just looking to have fun â€“ go ahead and make a song. I'm keeping the save/load API and song catalog open for everybody to share and enjoy. So please be responsible when naming your masterpiece. Thank you and start composing!
